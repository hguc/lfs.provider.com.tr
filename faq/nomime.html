  <hr title="Introduction">
  <h2><a name="intro"></a>What is wrong with sending HTML or MIME messages?</h2>

  <p>There are now <b>six</b> main reasons for <b>NOT</b>
doing  this: </p>

  <ol>
 <li>Many E-mail and Usenet News reader programs, usually
  the mail and news reader programs that come with browser packages,  allow
users to include binary attachments (MIME or other encoding)  or HTML (normally
found on web pages) within their E-mail messages.    This makes
URLs into clickable links and it means   that graphic images, formatting,
and even color coded    text can also be included in E-mail messages.
While   this makes your E-mail interesting and pretty to look
      at, it can cause problems for other people who   receive
your E-mail because they may use different E-mail   programs, different
computer systems, and different   application programs whose files
are often not fully   compatible with each other. Any of these
can cause   trouble with in-line HTML (or encoded attachments).
  Most of the time all they see is the actual HTML code
     behind the message. And if someone replies to the   HTML formatted
message, the quoting can render the   message even more unreadable.
In some cases, the   message is nothing but strange looking text.
For this    reason, many mailing lists especially those that
     provide a digest version, explicitly forbid the use
 of HTML formatted  e-mail. See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://expita.com/nomime.html#examples"> examples</a>
   section.
 <p>When you send an attachment, like a word   processor file,
  to have it appear on the other end as   the exact same type of
 file the recipient must have   hardware and software that can
read  that file. For   example, if you attach a Microsoft Word
file, and the   recipient of your message is using a word processor
  that can't open MS Word files, that person isn't
going  to be able to open your attachment and they are   less than
likely   to be very happy about it.</p>
 </li>
 <li>HTML or MIME messages are larger and more wasteful
than  simple text messages. Using HTML or MIME in E-mail   messages
makes  the messages larger in size by a   mimimum of two thirds
to more  than twenty times.   These will take longer to download
and they  take up   more storage space than standard plain text
E-mail   messages.
 <p>E-mail storage is important because many   people retain
  copies of messages they receive and in   the case of mailing
list    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1153.html">digests</a>
  ,   the individual messages are combined in one large
     message and sent to the user at the end of the day.   Some
 mailing list programs fail to format the digest   correctly if
HTML messages appear. In addition, many   mailing lists archive
the messages for periods of 6   months or more to enable users
to search for    particular past postings.</p>
 </li>
 <li>HTML or MIME messages leave or include unwanted files
   (attachments) on the machines of the recipients of   these messages.
     </li>
 <li>Embedded HTML or MIME attachments are the number one
  method of spreading virus, worm or Trojan programs.

 <p>For   instance, the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/vbs.forgotten.a.html"><i>
   Forgotten</i></a>      worm was written in Visual Basic Script
and spread   without any attachment. Instead, the worm code was
  embedded  into the HTML formatted message body. </p>

 <p>The<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-04.html"><em>
  I Love You</em></a>    worm program exploited an   ActiveX vulnerability
and was executed  just by   viewing or previewing the e-mail message
without   opening any attachment.</p>

 <p>Likewise, embedded code could exploit some MS   Office
  vulnerability as with <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/bulletin/ms99-030.asp">
   Office   ODBC Vulnerabilites</a>    and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-057.asp">
   Specially   Formed Script in HTML Mail can Execute in Exchange
  5.5</a>  </p>

 <p>HTML messages can trigger dialups to the Internet   if
  they contain links to specific images called   "web bugs" that
 are used to track message   and advertiser viewing. See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://www.eff.org/Privacy/Marketing/web_bug.html"> Web
  Bug FAQ</a>  </p>

 <p>MIME encoded attachments with file extensions (BAT,
COM, DOC, EML, EXE, HTA, JS, PPT, SHS, VBE, VBS, WSH,   XL#) have
been the most common method of sending   viruses, worms and Trojan
programs because their code   will be executed by Windows and associated
  viewers or   other MS programs when the attachment is opened.
  Windows uses the extension to determine what the
default  action on a file will be. For instance, a <em>.txt   </em>
file will open in Notepad and a <em>.html</em>   file will open
in Internet  Explorer. </p>

 <p>Uncommon, but no less dangerous are file   extensions
(386, ACM, ACV, ADT, AX, BIN, BTM, CLA,   CPL, CSC, CSH, DEV, DLL,
DOT, DRV, HLP, HTM, HTT,   INF, INI, JSE, JTD, MDB, MP#, MPP, MPT,
MSO, OBD,   OBT, OCX, OLE, OV#, PIF, PL, PM, POT, PP#, PPS, PRC,
   RAR, RTF, SCR, SH, SHB, SMM, SYS, VSD, VSS, VST, VXD,
 WSF, XL#, XLB, XTP).</p>
 </li>
 <li>HTML quickly fills the memory of PDAs (Personal   Digital
 Assistants like the Palm Pilot). In addition,   many HTML messages
 are also completely unreadable on   most PDAs.</li>
 <li>Some e-mail recipients may have set their background to something
  other   than white, may have chosen a typeface which they find
 most   readable and adjusted its size in accordance with their
visual acuity,   normal viewing distance, monitor size and screen
resolution.  All this   fine tuning is completely erased by HTML
e-mail.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>Plain text is how your messages should be formatted when     sending
  E-mail to mailing lists and Usenet newsgroups or to     any other recipient.
  Though this rule is not yet cast in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://www.fau.edu/netiquette/netiquette.html">   "Netiquette"</a>
   stone, it is a good policy to follow if you want quick and     informative
  responses to your questions and wish to avoid     being "flamed" as a clueless
  newbie. </p>

  <p>HTML is meant for the WWW; not for mailing lists, Usenet     newsgroups
  postings, proper business E-mail correspondence     and preferably not
for   personal E-mail unless the recipient     is expecting it. </p>

  <p>MIME encoded mail is generally used to send attachments     that consist
  of pictures, sound files, spreadsheets, word-processing     documents,
zip   files, or other binary files to recipients     that have and use the
same   operating system, the same word     processing program and a common
E-mail   program such as     Eudora, Pegasus, Netscape, or Outlook. </p>

  <p>MIME attachments are not wanted on mailing lists, Usenet     newsgroups
  postings, business E-mail correspondence, and     preferably not for personal
  E-mail unless the recipient is     expecting it. </p>

  <p>If you must send an attachment, then before you send the     message
  with the attachment, ALWAYS send the recipient a     message telling them
  you are about to send them an attachment.     This will, at least, let
them   know to expect a message with     an attachment from you. </p>

  <p>An exception to the "no MIME attachments rule"     can be made for PGP
  (Pretty Good Privacy), GPG (Gnu Privacy     Guard), or other "Digital ID"
  signed e-mail. In     this case, individuals, mailing lists, and Usenet
newsgroups that use signed e-mail are probably expecting it. See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2015.html">   MIME Security     with Pretty
Good Privacy (PGP)</a>   .</p>

  <hr title="for mime">
  <h2><a name="suggest"></a>For creators of HTML and MIME messages, here
are some suggestions</h2>

  <ul>
 <li>Know how your attachments are going to be sent. Bear
  in mind that what's reasonable for another recipient   isn't
necessarily  reasonable for the rest of the   world. For example,
sending a Microsoft Word document   as an attachment might not
work out as well as you   think it should.

 <p>If options are available for   turning off attachments,
  do so, except perhaps for   specific correspondents known to
have   the ability to   view the attachments. This is particularly
relevant     to users of mail systems in <i>Microsoft operating
  environments</i>. </p>

 <p>Microsoft TNEF data (WINMAIL.DAT attachments), for   example,
  which was very common during 1996 and 1997,   is not something
 that most Internet correspondents   can presently handle. In addition
  to attachments,   TNEF data may include links to OLE objects,
fonts,    colors, and other information that doesn't have the
      same form or meaning outside a <i>Microsoft operating
    environment</i>  . </p>
 </li>
 <li>Be somewhat conservative about Content-Types when   sending
 to mailing lists or other public forums.   Watch out for multipart/alternative.
     </li>
 <li>Watch character set selections and Content-Transfer
 encodings.  For example, some commonly used character   sets in
PCs use 8 bits,  not the standard 7 bits. </li>

  </ul>

  <hr title="agent">
  <h3><a name="agent"></a>   Agent/Free Agent</h3>

  <p>Agent currently does MIME quoted printable. Free Agent     does not.
    </p>

  <p>The MIME quoted printable option can be configured     separately for
  each language you have configured in Agent. </p>

  <ul>
 <li>Select Options </li>
 <li>Select General Preferences </li>
 <li>Select Languages </li>
 <li>Under Usenet Text and E-mail Text, make sure MIME is
  off.     </li>

  </ul>

  <hr title="aol">
  <h3><a name="aol"></a>   AOL 5.0 and earlier</h3>

  <p>AOL automatically converts all attachments to MIME when     you click
  on the "Attach" button. So don't use this     button. </p>

  <hr title="aol6">
  <h3><a name="aol6"></a>   AOL 6.0</h3>

  <p>AOL now supports Multipart/Alternative formatted messages     which
means that a single message sent from a user now     contains a plain-text
version and a formatted version. Users     who use e-mail programs that do
NOT support HTML will be able     to read the plain-text version of the message
without any of     the cryptic HTML codes. </p>

  <p>Likewise, if the e-mail client supports the HTML format,     then the
  user will read that version. </p>

  <p>The headers will show the Content-Type line similar to: </p>

  <pre>        Mime-Version: 1.0<br>        Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=blah...blah...<br>        Content-Disposition: Inline<br>        X-Mailer: 6.0 sub 171</pre>

  <p>AOL recommends this method to send plain text: </p>

  <ul>
 <li>Make sure your font is set to Arial (which should be
  the default).</li>
 <li>Type your message (in Arial) and then highlight it.
 Then,  right mouse click, select text, then select   normal.</li>

  <p>The "Customer Care" folks at AOL also offer the     following solution:
  Use <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://www.aol.com/aolmail/">AOL     Mail on the Web</a>
  to send mail to Internet addresses that     don't allow formatting - AOL
  Mail on the Web sends mail as     plain text only. </p>

  <p><b>NOTE:</b> To use AOL Mail on the Web you will need to signoff
    AOL. </p>

  <p>The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/">Unofficial
   AOL E-mail FAQ</a>    recommends that an AOL 6.0 user can turn     off
the HTML using the following  steps:</p>

  <ul>
 <li>Change global e-mail preferences (needs to be done
only  once):
 <ul>
     <li>Go to Keyword: Preferences (or choose <b>Preferences</b>
   from the <b>Settings</b> menu on the AOL 6.0
    toolbar). </li>
     <li>Click on <b>Font, Text, &amp; Graphics
     Preferences</b>  . </li>
     <li>Click on the Reset button at the bottom of
    the resulting window. <b>Do not make any      changes
 in the </b><b><b>Font      Preferences</b></b><b>
   area of the      window.</b></li>
     <li>Click on the <b>Save</b> button. </li>

 </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Change a specific e-mail to plain text (must be done
  for every e-mail):
 <ul>
     <li>Compose and address the e-mail as desired. </li>
     <li>Choose <b>Select All</b> from the <b>Edit</b>
 menu to highlight the entire message. </li>
     <li>With the mouse arrow somewhere over the
 highlighted  text, click the <b>Right</b>
mouse button, revealing a contextual menu. </li>
     <li>Choose <b>Normal</b> from the <b>Text</b>
  menu. </li>
     <li>Taking care not to make any further changes
     to the message, send it. </li>

 </ul>
 </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Note that changing the text to normal will eliminate the     "blue bar"
  quoted text indicator, but <b>will     not</b> remove some HTML
  elements of the quoted text.     The entire quoted section <b>must
be  deleted</b> (or     simply not quoted in the first place), followed
 by the re-entry     of the text and manually quoted, prior to changing the
 text to     normal. Changing the text to normal will <em>also</em>     eliminate
  any styled text that would have been seen by AOL     recipients of the
message,   which cannot be re-added. Testing     also suggests that messages
with hyperlinks   cannot be     converted to normal text, requiring the prior
removal of the  link.</p>

  <h3><a name="aol7"></a>   AOL 7.0</h3>

  <p>If you upgrade from AOL 6.0 to AOL 7.0 and up have     customized your
  fonts/colors, the changes carry over during     the upgrade and so you
still   need to go into Settings and switch back to the defaults as described
  above for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://expita.com/nomime.html#aol6">AOL 6.0</a>   </p>

  <p>To turn off HTML, use the following steps:</p>

  <ul>
 <li>Change global e-mail preferences (needs to be done
only  once):
 <ul>
     <li>Go to Keyword: Preferences (or choose <b>Preferences</b>
   from the <b>Settings</b> menu on the AOL 7.0
    toolbar). </li>
     <li>Click on <b>Font, Text, &amp; Graphics
     Preferences</b>  . </li>
     <li>Click on the Reset button at the bottom of
    the resulting window. <b>Do not make any      changes
 in the </b><b><b>Font      Preferences</b></b><b>
   area of the      window.</b></li>
     <li>Click on the <b>Save</b> button. </li>

 </ul>
 </li>

  </ul>

  <p>WARNING: Any attempt to change the font face, size, style, or color
 within the body of an e-mail message will change the message format  to
HTML, as will any attempt to use a different default font face,  size, style,
or color.</p>

  <p>Lastly, you must remove your e-mail signature if it contains any  styled
  text, as that will also change the message format back to HTML.</p>

  <p>Like AOL 6, AOL 7 will use HTML when quoting a message  (displaying
the quoted portion with a blue line in the left margin).  And like AOL 6,
choosing Text - Normal will eliminate any indication  that the text was quoted.
However, unlike AOL 6, the message will now  be sent in plain text. However,
the quoted portion will need to be  manually quoted.</p>

  <h3><a name="aol8"></a> AOL 8.0</h3>

  <p>This version appears to be incapable of sending plain text e-mail.</p>

  <hr title="aolcd">
  <h3><a name="aolcd"></a> AOL 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 Alternate</h3>

  <p>Simply install the 'safe' version of AOL, version 5.0, on your computer
  and    use it for your plain text mailing lists.  Create or use one
 of your 8 allowed AOL screen    names to subscribe to; and to read,
send, and reply to the list's mail.  AOL    5.0 will not send HTML or
RTF encoded e-mail unless <b>YOU</b> add it    (stationery/background;
colored, bold, or italicized text; insert an image; etc.).</p>

  <p>Place one of the ubiquitous free AOL 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0 CDs (available
     everywhere!) in your CD-ROM drive, hold down the shift key and
close   the tray to stop    the autoplay feature. If that doesn't work,
close   the install window when it    comes up.  Then, using "Windows
Explorer"   or "My Computer",    navigate to the AOL 5.0 folder (resident
on all   these CDs) and double-click on    the 'setup' program file.
 Don't let  the install program overwrite any other AOL    version if
prompted or  asked during the AOL 5.0 install.</p>

  <p>After the install, whenever you want to send plain text e-mail to any
  Internet Mailing     list, simply close any later version of AOL,
click   on  the AOL 5.0 version, sign on     with your list-dedicated
screen   name and send your own list e-mails without     worry of offending
others  with HTML or RTF encoded e-mail.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> An alternative if you are using AOL 6.0,
7.0 or 8.0 is to log on to AOL and select either Netscape or
Internet Explorer as your browser. <b>WARNING: Do not use AOL's web
browser.</b> Start either browser and type "www.aol.com" in the URL
field. Sign on with your ScreenName and Password. Click on "AOL

  <h3><a name="aol9"></a> AOL 9.0</h3>

    <p>Copied directly from
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://channelevents.aol.com/flash/com_mentor/guide.pdf/">AOL
     Communicator Help</a> manual page 66</p>
    <p><b>Changing Plain Text Settings</b></p>

    <p>By default, AOL Communicator Mail sends messages in HTML format.
    Messages sent in this format allow you to use different fonts and
    font sizes; underline, boldface, or italicize text; easily create
    bulleted or numbered lists and links to web sites; and attach files.</p>

    <p>Not all mail programs support HTML, and not all users prefer to
    receive HTML-formatted messages. Some programs display messages in
    HTML format as if they were in plain text, including HTML tags and
    other format coding that can make the original message difficult to
    read.</p>

    <p>If you are sending a message to someone who can&#8217;t read
    HTML-formatted messages (also called 'rich text'), you can switch to
    plain text. You can also specify plain text only for messages sent
    to a specific address or domain.</p>

    <p>Messages sent in plain text lose all formatting and attachments.
    Replies to (and forwarded) plain text messages are also sent in
    plain text.</p>

    <p>To change the plain text setting while you are composing a
    message:
    </p><ol>
    <li>Click in the message area of the Write Mail window.</li>
    <li>Change the plain text setting:</li>
    <li>Click the T icon just below the Subject label to toggle the
    message between plain text and rich text formatting; or</li>
    <li>Open the Format menu and choose Rich Text or Plain Text.</li>
    </ol><p></p>

    <p>When the T icon is red, the message uses rich text. When the T
    icon is black, the message uses plain text.</p>

    <p>When you change the plain text setting from a Write Mail window,
    the setting 'sticks' for all subsequent messages you write. For
    example, if you switch from rich text to plain text for one message
    and then open a new Write Mail window, that window will also be set
    to use plain text. To change the plain text setting for all messages
    you send to an address or domain:
    </p><ol>
    <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.</li>
    <li>Click Advanced Options.</li>
    <li>Click Add.</li>
    <li>Type the email address or domain for which you want all messages
    to be sent in plain text. If you specify a domain (such as
    example.net), you&#8217;ll have an opportunity to switch to plain text
    whenever you address a message to an email address that includes
    that domain.</li>
    <li>Click OK.</li>

  <p><b>WARNING</b>: Outlook 2000 uses what Microsoft     calls
  Auto Format Reply. Due to the variety of message     formats supported
by   different e-mail clients, Outlook 2000     ensures that e-mail recipients
  receive replies they can read     easily. When users reply to a message,
 Outlook automatically     uses the format of the original message. This
is  especially     frustrating if you receive HTML e-mail and wish to send
Plain  Text e-mail.</p>

  <p>To override the default for any individual message, click     on the
  "Format" menu within the message and choose     the desired format. Outlook
  2000 lets you select the e-mail     format for a mail message in what they
  call <em>one-off     editor switching.</em> You can start a new message
in  a     different format than the standard one by selecting New Mail
  Message  Using from the Actions menu. </p>

  <p>Outlook doesn't have any way to select the mail format to     use when
  sending mail to a particular recipient when you use     the drop-down list
  on a Contact item or an Address list entry.     </p>

  <p><b>NOTE</b>: A problem you may encounter when     you open
  an incoming e-mail message, you may see a blank     message or three less
  than symbols (&lt;&lt;&lt;) displayed     instead of the message text.</p>

  <p>In some cases, depending on the Internet e-mail software     used, the
  message may contain other random, unrelated     characters or the message
  body may be blank. </p>

  <p>Outlook 2002 eliminates the distinction between Corporate/Workgroup
   and Internet Mail Only modes that made supporting Outlook 98     and Outlook
2000 so difficult. You can now change the format     of a message you already
received or created to make the     message either easier for you to view
or to send to someone     else. </p>

  <ul>
 <li>With the message open, on the menu bar: select "Format"
     </li>
 <li>On the "Format" menu Select the format you   want to
change  the message to: The menu list offers   three choices: Plain
Text,  Microsoft Rich Text, and   HTML. Select Plain Text.</li>
 <li>If Microsoft Word is your e-mail editor, these   options
  may not be available. <br>
       <b>NOTE:</b> Outlook Help states that you can
switch message     formats after starting an e-mail message, but this
  doesn't   work if you use Word as your e-mail editor,
     only if you use the  internal Outlook mail editor (and   then
only switch between plain  text and HTML formats).    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Outlook 2002 supports better reading and printing of plain     text
mail messages by allowing the user to remove extra     paragraph marks. They
are easily restored if you need them,     for example to format tabular data.
  To turn this feature on     or off, </p>

  <ul>
 <li>Choose "Tools"</li>
 <li>Select "Options"</li>
 <li>Select "Email Options"</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>WARNING</b>: There are known problem with     this feature.

  <p><b>WARNING</b>: In earlier versions of Microsoft     Outlook,
  you had the ability to break apart messages that     were larger than a
specified  size ranging from a value     between 16 KB (kilobytes) and 8000
KB. This  capability has     been removed from the product in Outlook 2002.
See this Knowledge Base article: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q287766">
  OL2002:     The Option to Break Apart Large Messages Is Missing (Q287766)</a>
   </p>

  <p><b>NOTE</b>: The setting to adjust the line     length of
plain text messages no longer works. Even if you     change it from the default
  of 76 characters, Outlook 2002     appears to always use 72 characters
as   the line length.</p>

  <p><b>WARNING</b>: You cannot set the default     format for
Internet plain text messages to quoted-printable (which     puts in soft
returns, not hard returns at the end of each     line). This makes long URLs
in plain text messages unusable.     A Microsoft Knowledgebase article describes
how to modify the     registry to set the default encoding format for plain
text     messages to quoted-printable. See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q278134">
  OL2002:     How Outlook Applies Encoding to Plain Text Messages (Q278134).</a>
   </p>

  <p>However, this setting may not work. As stated in the     article, "Whether
  or not Outlook honors this registry     setting depends on what software
 creates MIME on the user's     behalf; when Outlook uses Exchange to send
 the message,     Outlook does not honor this registry setting." While it
    does set the Content-Transfer-Encoding to quoted-printable,     Outlook
 performs only partial Base64 or MIME encoding --     handling 8-bit characters,
 but not soft line feeds.</p>

  <p><b>NOTE:</b> It has been brought to my attention that Outlook
    Express occasionally  breaks all lines at the set margin after     you
send an e-mail message on  a reply or forward. So the     lines Outlook Express
marks with "&gt; " get wrapped after the "&gt; " mark and the recipeient
    gets something   awful to look at and entirely different than     what
it looked like before   you sent it.<br>
    <br>
    To prevent this from happening, you may want to set the     margin
 at 132 (maximum possible value) and break the lines at     72 to 75 characters
  manually.</p>

  <p><br>
    All of your messages will now be sent as plain text. Outlook
 Express  can also be configured to send Business Cards (also     referred

  <h3><a name="winmail"></a>   WINMAIL.DAT</h3>

  <p>When I send mail to an Internet mailing list, its members     complain
  that my messages contain big binary attachments     called WINMAIL.DAT.
What's  happening? How can I get rid of     these? </p>

  <p>Either intentionally or accidentally, you have been     sending messages
  in Microsoft rich text format to recipients     using mail programs that
 cannot decipher this format. </p>

  <p>When Exchange thinks that it is sending mail to another     Exchange
  user on the Internet, Exchange (more properly, the     Internet Mail message
  service provider) encodes the message,     along with attached files, embedded
  OLE objects, and their     associated icons, into a special data block
called   the TNEF (pronounced     tee-neff) block. This block can be seen
in the mail  header     and looks similar to: </p>

  <pre>        ------ =_NextPart_000_01BB9403.FCDBDA20<br>        Content-Type: application/ms-tnef<br>        Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64</pre>

  <p>This block encapsulates the complete original content of     the Exchange
  message, so that the message arrives at its     destination with all proper
  formatting intact, including     boldface, underlining, fonts, and colors.
  Otherwise, Exchange     formats the message in an Internet standard fashion,
 discarding all rich text attributes and ensuring that all     attached
  files appear as standard attachments. </p>

  <p>The problem arises when people not using Exchange or     Outlook receive
  a message in the TNEF format instead of     seeing a formatted message,
they  see a big chunk of UUENCODEd     data if the sender used UUENCODE format,
  or a MIME body part     application/ms-tnef if the sender used MIME. Depending
  upon     which mail program they use, they may either see a long     sequence
  of hexadecimal digits, or they may see an attached     binary file named
 WINMAIL.DAT.   </p>

  <p>Exchange specifies whether it emits TNEF or not as a     property of
  the recipient, appearing as a field on the     property page of the underlined
  recipient object within an     Exchange To or Cc field. (The underline
in   the To field means     that Exchange has recognized the name, and associated
  an     address and other information with it.) To see this recipient
  property page, double click the underlined recipient: when     using either
 the Internet Mail provider or Microsoft Exchange     Server, the popup that
 appears should include a check box     labeled Send to this recipient in
Microsoft rich text format.     If this check box is set, Exchange/Internet
Mail will use a     TNEF block when sending messages to that user; otherwise,
it     will strip the rich information and send plain text. The     sender
can also set and clear this flag on entries in the     Personal Address Book.
 Should the sender address a message     using an entry from the Address
Book,  Exchange will use the     setting of this flag from that entry. </p>

  <p>Never set this check box if you suspect that your     recipient isn't
  using Exchange or Outlook, or if you are     sending mail to an Internet
 mailing list. Otherwise, your     mail will include binary garbage. </p>

  <p>Here's how to turn it off: </p>

  <p>Step #1: </p>

  <ul>
 <li>Double click on the Mail and Fax icon in Control   Panel.
     </li>
 <li>Click on the Services tab, and select Internet Mail
 from  the list. If Internet Mail is not listed, click   Add -
add this  service. </li>
 <li>Click Properties, and then Message Format. </li>
 <li>Turn off the option that reads Use MIME when sending
  messages.     </li>
 <li>Click OK and then OK again. </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Step #2: </p>

  <ul>
 <li>Double click on the name of each recipient in your
Address  Book. </li>
 <li>Turn off the option that reads Always send to this
recipient  in Microsoft rich text format. </li>
 <li>This option needs to be set for each recipient of a
 message  - if even one has this turned on, all   recipients will
still get  the attachment. </li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>NOTE:</b> Either of these methods should work for most
users,     but sometimes  nothing seems to work - yet another brilliant
   design strategy by Microsoft.   If you plan to be sending lots     of
internet e-mail, you should seriously   consider using a     mail program
more suited to the task, such as Pegasus   or     Eudora. </p>

  <p><b>NOTE:</b> A bug ("feature"?) in Exchange may cause
line feeds to be replaced with equal signs when rich text     mail is disabled.
  </p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there are several ways to send Internet     mail messages
  in TNEF format by accident. </p>

  <ul>
 <li>If you address the message by typing a literal   name@domain.xxx
  SMTP address, or by entering the   address in Exchange's explicit
  one off format - i.e.,   by typing [SMTP:name@domain.xxx] - and
  you use the   version of Microsoft Exchange released with retail
    Windows 95 (as opposed to Windows Messaging, or the
    version released as the client of Microsoft Exchange   Server),
  the entry will have its Send to this   recipient in Microsoft
rich  text format check box set   by default. </li>
 <li>If you address the message by typing a name and   letting
 the system pick an entry from your Personal   Address Book, and
 that address book entry specifies   Send to this recipient in Microsoft
 rich text format,   then the recipient in the message will, too.
     </li>
 <li>If you address the message by giving the reply   command
  in Exchange, and the message to which you   were replying had
an  explicit RFC822 Reply-To header   (such as is the case on many
 messages arriving via   Internet mailing lists), and you use a
version of the   Internet Mail provider prior to the Internet Mail
   Enhancement Patch (IMEP), the resulting entry in the
     To field will have its Send to this recipient in   Microsoft
rich text format check box set by default.   Note that a reply
will never reference an entry in   your Personal Address Book unless
  you replace the   contents of the reply note's To field yourself.
 </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Some workarounds: </p>

  <ul>
 <li>If you are using the original version of retail   Windows
 95 Microsoft Exchange, update to a more   recent version, such
as the Windows Messaging update.    </li>
 <li>Know the contents of your Personal Address Book, and
  ensure that you have not erroneously set the rich   text flag
on any entries therein. </li>
 <li>Use the most recent version of the Internet Mail   message
 service provider. (Note: Microsoft Exchange   Server users do not
 use this component, since they   send mail to the Internet through
 a component of   Exchange Server.) </li>
 <li>On replies to Internet mailing lists, manually clear
  the rich text flag, or else replace the reply address   with
a known entry from your Personal Address Book. </li>
 <li>Use <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://www.darkweb.com/%7Ebeng/exchange/rtfguard.htm">   "RTFGuard"</a>
      or Rich Text Sentry widget, which watches for
 outgoing  Internet messages in rich text format, or   install
a recent version  of Internet Idioms and   configure it to do likewise.</li>

  <p>The entire preceding discussion assumes that you are using     either
  the Internet Mail (SMTP/POP3) or Microsoft Exchange     Server messaging
 service. If instead you are using the     Microsoft Mail messaging service,
 and depending on a     Microsoft Mail gateway to carry your message onto

  <hr title="equalsign">
  <h3><a name="equalsign"></a>   Equal signs at end of lines</h3>

  <p>When I send mail to Internet users, they complain that my     text has
  equals signs at the end of each line. What is this?     How can I make
it   stop? </p>

  <p>You are sending your messages in the MIME message format.     The Microsoft
  Internet Mail program sends plain text messages     in a MIME format called
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: Quoted-Printable.     The mail header usually
 shows something similar to: </p>

  <pre>        Mime-Version: 1.0<br>        Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1<br>        Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable</pre>

  <p>If you find this bothersome, you have several options. You     can keep
  all of your lines less than 76 characters long, in     which case the Internet
  Mail service provider will not have     to insert these soft line break
sequences.  You can send your     mail in a format other than MIME, via the
Message Format setting. If your correspondent is using Exchange, you
can     specify  that Exchange send rich text along with the message.
 Or your correspondent  can use a MIME mail reader, which     presumably
will know how to handle this encoding correctly. </p>

  <p>Some e-mail programs, most notably those from Microsoft     that use
    <em>quoted-printable</em> encoding can encode high     order ASCII characters
  using a scheme where the equal sign     ("=") indicates a character to
be   decoded followed     by the hexadecimal string value of the character
to  be     encoded. This system of course assumes that the client e-mail
    program can decode these characters (which most can). Things     that
trigger automatic   <em>quoted-printable</em> encoding:</p>

  <ol>
 <li>High order characters - characters with the following
   ordinal values 0..31,61,128..255 </li>
 <li>Long lines in a message body (you can turn wordwrap
 on  to fix this)</li>

  </ol>

  <p>If your message contains extended characters coded in q<em>uoted-printable</em>
   format your e-mail client may append the following preamble     to
 your message: </p>

  <p><i>Sender composed mail containing characters not in the     US-ASCII
  set</i><br>
    <i>These characters have been transformed into a printable     form.</i></p>

  <p>This is identified in the mail header under the Content-Type     line
  similar to: </p>

  <pre>        Mime-Version: 1.0<br>        Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1<br>        Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable</pre>

  <p>To correct this, change your default character set from     ISO 8859-1
  to US ASCII, or else take any of the precautions     listed above. For
more   information, see the Knowledge Base     articles <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071927/http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q146/6/29.asp">

   .     The mail headers should then show: </p>

  <pre>        Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii</pre>

  <p>Note that the Exchange Server Internet Mail Connector (IMC)     only
  encodes content this way on multipart MIME messages.     When the IMC processes
  a message lacking extended characters     or attachments, it instead hard
  wraps the plain text. </p>

  <p>MIME and HTML are enabled by the mail program's default rich text
format (RTF) but can easily be turned off on a message-by-message basis.
Simply opening a new message window and then go to the "Format" menu  and
select "Make Plain Text". </p>

  <p>You can turn off RTF permanently by going to the "Mail Menu" and select
"Preferences" then choose "Composing".  At the top of the new window select
"Format: Plain Text". Now all outgoing messages are plain text by default.</p>

  <p><b>NOTE:</b> AOL 10.2.1 for Mac OS X appears  incapable of
sending plain text e-mail.</p>

  <hr title="groupwise">
  <h3><a name="groupwise"></a>   Novell Groupwise</h3>

  <p>Generally it is assumed that the e-mail server does not     alter the
  message at all, and that the sender and their     client software is entirely
  in control of the message which     is sent. In some systems, such as Lotus
  ccMail, Lotus Notes,     Microsoft Exchange or Novell Groupwise, the client
  and server     do not follow this model, do not use Internet standards
and  do not necessarily follow the conventions and standards of
Internet   e-mail. In those cases compatibility with Internet     standards
may be handled  by a third item of software - a     gateway. Thus there can
be problems of  a significant     difference between what the sender sees
when they write   the e-mail     (which is probably similar to how it appears
to recipients   in     their office), and what is actually sent to Internet
    recipients.     </p>

  <p>Users of Internet compliant software sometimes disparage     the continued
  use of proprietary systems such as Novell     Groupwise or Lotus Notes,
based  on the awkward or hard-to-read     e-mails they sometimes receive
from these  systems. However     their continued use is inevitable since
within their  own     system they provide additional powerful "groupware"
    functionality  which is valuable to larger organizations and     which
cannot currently be provided with standard Internet     protocols. All these
systems can be configured to respect     Internet technical standards and
conventions (although perhaps not in a way which the sender can see
or control) -     the problem  is that they are sometimes mis-configured
by     default, creating difficulties  for all their users. </p>

  <p>Some e-mail client programs can be configured (or are     configured
  by default) to send each paragraph as one long     line. Some e-mail systems
  such as Groupwise (and apparently     Lotus Notes), have a single setting
  in the server (the     Message Transfer Agent, which may include a SMTP
gateway) which either wraps all outgoing e-mails of all users to a
   particular  line length, or sends all e-mails of all users     with each
paragraph as  an arbitrarily long line (unless the     user manually sets
the line length  by pressing "enter").     In neither case does the user
control this single,  system-wide,     setting. Nor may the server's wrapping
correspond to what they see on screen when writing. </p>

  <p>Arbitrarily long lines can be sent within SMTP standards     using the
  "quoted-printable" MIME type. </p>

  <p>If such arbitrarily long lines are sent as plain text,     then the
1,000 character limit of SMTP may be reached and the     sending client or
system may wrap the line arbitrarily there,     or may send it out longer
than 1,000 characters. If this     happens, a recipient SMTP server may reject
it, or break the     line. In one instance a plain text e-mail from Groupwise
4.2     exceeded the 1,000 character per line limit. That paragraph,
of 1,253 characters was broken in mid word by a SMTP server     just before
the 1,000th character. This and later versions of     Groupwise are used
in a significant number of VET institutes,     where the system is valued
for many functions apart from its     Internet e-mail capabilities. </p>

  <p>Quoting styles. The established approach to quoting a line     of text:
  "&gt; " or "&gt;" is no longer     the only approach. Other methods, which
  are the default in     Groupwise and perhaps other clients or e-mail systems,
  are     much harder to understand, at least in some circumstances,
since   they mark only the start of the paragraph as a comment,     rather
than the  start of each line. A plethora of     incompatible quoting styles
is a source  of error and     frustration for novices and experienced users
alike - so  an     operational guideline standardise on "&gt; " or     "&gt;"
was decided  upon, with the matter to be     reviewed within 12 months or
so. </p>

  <p>I have been informed that the issue regarding line wrapping is
indeed set at the gateway - in Groupwise 5.2 and up, this is known as
the "GWIA".  There are additional settings controlling the type of MIME
encoding, etc.</p>

  <p>Additionally, in GW5.5 EP (for Enhancement Pack) and higher on
Windows, HTML first became available for reading and authoring mail
(provided Internet Explorer is installed).</p>

  <p>In Groupwise 5.5EP, the message format is controlled from the Groupwise
  client. When composing mail:     </p>

  <ul>
 <li>Click on "View"</li>
 <li>Then select either "Plain Text" or "HTML"</li>

  </ul>
      The client then remembers that setting.
  <p><b>WARNING:</b> The GW client will turn the HTML setting back
on all  by  itself if the user receives or reads e-mail that has been MIME
encoded   with  HTML.</p>

     allows you to set the method used to handle 8-bit (non-ASCII)

  this feature is not very significant to you   because all English
  characters are ASCII characters   and will go through the net
without  any problems.   However, if you are using accented characters
or    character sets other than English, you should choose
   the method carefully because there still are some   mail
servers  which do not allow appearance of 8-bit   characters in
e-mail messages.  If you are not sure   that such servers are functioning
 in the way you   write your messages, it is better to choose either
   Base64 or Quoted-printable encoding. The difference
    between these two encoding methods is that Base64   produces
totally unreadable text. Quoted-printable   encoding still can
be read if your alphabet is almost   Latin, only accented characters
are encoded. If your   recipient's are using The Bat! or another
